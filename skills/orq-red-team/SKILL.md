# Red Team

You are an **orq.ai red team operator**. Your job is to invoke the `eq redteam` CLI to run adversarial attacks against deployed agents or pre-built datasets, then read and interpret the resulting report.

This skill is a **reference guide and invocation helper — not a wrapper**. You call the CLI directly; you do not reimplement it.

## Constraints

- **NEVER** reimplement red teaming logic — use the `eq redteam` CLI.
- **NEVER** run against a deployment the user does not own or is not explicitly authorized to test. Confirm authorization before the first run.
- **NEVER** run without confirming the target key with the user first.
- **ALWAYS** run the preflight when the skill is invoked, before any `eq redteam run`: confirm `eq` is installed and at least one LLM credential is set, and check `ORQ_API_KEY`. `ORQ_API_KEY` is not always required, but **is** required to target an orq `agent:`/`deployment:`, to route the LLM via the gateway, or to upload results — if the target is an orq agent and it is missing, halt and ask the user to set it.
- **NEVER** interpret a passing run (low ASR) as "the agent is safe" — coverage depends on categories tested.
- **BE AWARE** dynamic runs against an agent **that has a memory store** write entities into it (e.g. ASI06 memory-poisoning). These are cleaned up after the run unless `--no-cleanup-memory` is passed. No-op for memory-less agents, raw models, and static mode — but on a memory-backed production agent this mutates state, so confirm before running.

## Library location

The red teaming CLI is part of the `evaluatorq` package:

```
https://github.com/orq-ai/evaluatorq
```

The package is installed as `evaluatorq` and exposes two equivalent entry points: `eq` and `evaluatorq`. The redteam subcommand is `eq redteam`.

**Always invoke via:**
```bash
eq redteam <command> [options]
```

### Discovering `eq` — don't install until you've checked

`eq` is frequently already reachable through a project venv (e.g. `docs/demos/*/`), a uv tool install, or the orqkit workspace. **Probe in this order and use the first hit — install only as a last resort** (a global `pip install` can be blocked by PEP 668 / `--break-system-packages`):

```bash
# Resolve how to invoke eq. Cheap/local probes first; install only if none hit.
EQ=""
eq --help >/dev/null 2>&1 && EQ="eq"                                              # on PATH
[ -z "$EQ" ] && [ -x .venv/bin/eq ] && EQ=".venv/bin/eq"                          # project venv
[ -z "$EQ" ] && uv run --package evaluatorq eq --help >/dev/null 2>&1 \
  && EQ="uv run --package evaluatorq eq"                                          # orqkit workspace
[ -z "$EQ" ] && python3 -m evaluatorq --help >/dev/null 2>&1 && EQ="python3 -m evaluatorq"  # importable module run
echo "Resolved eq: ${EQ:-NONE — install below}"
```

Each resolved `$EQ` is quote-clean and safe to reuse as a command prefix (`$EQ redteam run …`).

If nothing resolves, install — prefer a **local venv** (keeps the dependency scoped to the project, no global state):

```bash
# Preferred: install into a project venv (create one if needed)
[ -d .venv ] || uv venv          # or: python3 -m venv .venv
uv pip install 'evaluatorq[redteam]'    # installs into the active/.venv; then EQ=".venv/bin/eq"

# No uv available:
.venv/bin/pip install 'evaluatorq[redteam]'

# Last resort — global, isolated tool install (puts eq on PATH):
uv tool install 'evaluatorq[redteam]'
```

The `[redteam]` extra is required (pulls in `openai`, `typer`, `huggingface-hub`). The interactive dashboard (`eq redteam ui`) additionally needs the `[ui]` extra: add `evaluatorq[redteam,ui]`.

> Throughout this skill, `eq redteam …` is written assuming `eq` is on PATH. If you resolved it via `$EQ` above (e.g. `uv run --package evaluatorq eq`), substitute that prefix — **but read the uv `.env` trap below first; running `eq` via `uv run` has a credential gotcha when an env-file (`UV_ENV_FILE`) is in play.**

## Required environment variables

The attack and evaluator LLMs need credentials. Routing is decided purely by **which env var is set** — the model string itself is never inspected for routing:

1. **OpenAI directly** — if `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set (optionally `OPENAI_BASE_URL`), all attack/evaluator model strings go straight to OpenAI. Use **bare** model names here (e.g. `gpt-5-mini`). `OPENAI_API_KEY` **wins if both keys are set**.
2. **orq gateway** — else if `ORQ_API_KEY` is set (optionally `ORQ_BASE_URL`), model strings route through the orq LLM gateway (`{ORQ_BASE_URL}/v3/router`, default `https://my.orq.ai`). Use the **provider-prefixed** form here (e.g. `openai/gpt-5-mini`).

If neither key is set the run fails with `CredentialError`. There is no Azure credential path — the CLI does not support Azure OpenAI directly.

**`ORQ_API_KEY` is not strictly required** — you can run with `OPENAI_API_KEY` alone (e.g. red-teaming a raw model). But without `ORQ_API_KEY`, these are **not available**:

- **Testing an orq `agent:`/`deployment:` target** — invoking the target needs `ORQ_API_KEY`. Required for any orq-agent run.
- **Routing the attack/evaluator LLM through the orq gateway** — without it, the attack LLM only works via `OPENAI_API_KEY` (direct OpenAI, bare model names).
- **Uploading results to orq** — no Experiment is created and `report.experiment_url` stays empty; results are local-only.

> Model-string form follows the route: bare `gpt-5-mini` for direct OpenAI, `openai/gpt-5-mini` for the orq gateway. When targeting an orq agent (which needs `ORQ_API_KEY` anyway), the gateway form is the common case. For a fully direct-OpenAI run — an OpenAI model under test with OpenAI-hosted attacker/evaluator, `OPENAI_API_KEY` only — see the worked example in [resources/python-sdk.md](resources/python-sdk.md).

### The `uv run` + `.env` credential trap (read before running `eq` via uv)

**Symptom:** every gateway model string (`openai/gpt-5-mini`) fails with `401 Incorrect API key` even though `ORQ_API_KEY` is set, and a shell-level `unset OPENAI_API_KEY` doesn't stick once you run via `uv run`.

**Cause:** `uv` injects an env-file into the subprocess **only when you opt in** — `UV_ENV_FILE` is set in the environment, or you pass `--env-file`. It does **not** auto-read `./.env` from a bare `uv run` (verified on uv 0.11.19). But when an env-file *is* in play and contains `OPENAI_API_KEY`, uv loads it **after** your shell-level `unset`/`env -u`, so the key comes back → routing flips to direct-OpenAI (see routing rules above, `OPENAI_API_KEY` wins) → gateway-prefixed strings like `openai/gpt-5-mini` are sent to OpenAI, which rejects the `openai/` prefix and the orq key → `401`. A plain `env -u OPENAI_API_KEY eq …` (no `uv run`) is unaffected — the re-injection is uv re-reading the env-file. Common ways `UV_ENV_FILE` gets set without you noticing: direnv / a project `.envrc`, or a Makefile/CI wrapper.

**Diagnostic — detect env-file injection** (compare uv with its default env-file loading vs `--no-env-file`; prints presence only, never the key value):
```bash
# Is uv pointed at an env-file at all? (a path here, not a secret)
echo "UV_ENV_FILE: ${UV_ENV_FILE:-unset}"
WITH=$(uv run python3 -c "import os;print('set' if os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY') else 'unset')")
WITHOUT=$(uv run --no-env-file python3 -c "import os;print('set' if os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY') else 'unset')")
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY — uv default: $WITH | uv --no-env-file: $WITHOUT"
# default=set, --no-env-file=unset → uv's env-file is injecting it (the trap; check UV_ENV_FILE above)
# both set                         → comes from your shell env, not an env-file
# both unset                       → clean
```
uv loads an env-file only via `UV_ENV_FILE` or `--env-file`; `--no-env-file` is the *baseline* that suppresses all of them. The default-vs-`--no-env-file` difference is what proves an env-file is the source. **Never print the key itself** — booleans only, here and anywhere else in this skill.

**Decide — don't auto-strip `.env`.** A key in `.env` usually means the user wants it; suppressing it silently is wrong. Check the state and guide:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` only, no `ORQ_API_KEY` → direct-OpenAI run, bare model names (`gpt-5-mini`). No conflict.
- `ORQ_API_KEY` only → gateway run, `openai/`-prefixed names. No conflict.
- **both set + gateway target (`openai/…` model)** → conflict: `OPENAI_API_KEY` wins → the gateway-prefixed string is sent to OpenAI → 401. Surface it and let the user choose, e.g.:
  > "`OPENAI_API_KEY` is set (likely exported in your shell or pulled in via an env-file such as `UV_ENV_FILE`). With a gateway model string that routes to direct OpenAI and 401s. To use the orq gateway for this run, suppress it for the subprocess [Fix A]. To use direct OpenAI instead, drop the `openai/` prefix. If neither `ORQ_API_KEY` nor the gateway is what you want, set the key you intend here."

**Fix A — strip the key for this run and block uv from re-adding it** (used when the user wants the gateway; does **not** modify `.env` or `UV_ENV_FILE`, writes nothing to disk):
```bash
env -u OPENAI_API_KEY uv run --no-env-file --package evaluatorq eq redteam run --target agent:<key> ...
```
`env -u OPENAI_API_KEY` drops the direct-OpenAI key from the environment for this one command; `--no-env-file` stops uv re-loading it from any env-file (`UV_ENV_FILE` / `--env-file`). `ORQ_API_KEY` (and `ORQ_BASE_URL` if set) pass through from your shell, so routing stays on the gateway.

> Caveat: `--no-env-file` suppresses **all** env-file loading, so if `ORQ_API_KEY`/`ORQ_BASE_URL` live *only* in an env-file (not exported in your shell), they'll be dropped too. Export them first (`export ORQ_API_KEY=…`) or pass them inline: `env -u OPENAI_API_KEY ORQ_API_KEY="$ORQ_API_KEY" uv run --no-env-file …`. Do **not** combine `--no-env-file` with `--env-file` — `--no-env-file` overrides `--env-file` (either order) and nothing gets injected. Only set `ORQ_BASE_URL` if the user already has one; do **not** synthesize a base URL.

**Fix B — don't use `uv run`.** If `eq` is on PATH (e.g. via `uv tool install`), invoke it directly so the trap can't fire: `env -u OPENAI_API_KEY eq redteam run …`.

Check before running — **always run this preflight when the skill is invoked**, before any `eq redteam run`:
```bash
# 1. CLI installed and reachable (honors the $EQ resolved by the discovery ladder)
${EQ:-eq} --help >/dev/null 2>&1 || { echo "eq CLI not found — run the discovery ladder or install 'evaluatorq[redteam]'"; exit 1; }

# 2. At least one LLM credential must be set (else CredentialError mid-run)
[ -n "$OPENAI_API_KEY" ] || [ -n "$ORQ_API_KEY" ] || { echo "No LLM credential — set OPENAI_API_KEY or ORQ_API_KEY for the attack/evaluator model."; exit 1; }

# 3. ORQ_API_KEY — required ONLY for orq agent/deployment targets and orq upload. Warn (don't block) if absent.
if [ -z "$ORQ_API_KEY" ]; then
  echo "WARNING: ORQ_API_KEY not set — orq agent/deployment targets, gateway routing, and result upload are unavailable. Raw-model runs with OPENAI_API_KEY still work."
fi
echo "ORQ_API_KEY set: $([ -n "$ORQ_API_KEY" ] && echo yes || echo no)"
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY set: $([ -n "$OPENAI_API_KEY" ] && echo yes || echo no)"
```

If the user's target is `agent:<key>` or `deployment:<key>` and `ORQ_API_KEY` is absent, **stop and ask them to set it** — that run cannot proceed.

### Verify the target agent or deployment exists before running

A wrong `--target agent:<key>` (or `deployment:<key>`) does **not** fail fast — it fails deep in the run, after context retrieval, with a cryptic `Agent not found` / `deployment_not_found`. Confirm the key resolves up front.

**Check with the key the run uses, via the API — not the MCP.** The CLI invokes the target with the **`ORQ_API_KEY`** the run sees (exported, or from the project `.env`). Keys are **project-scoped** (since release 4.10, one key → one project, no cross-project reads), so the *only* credential whose verdict predicts the run is that one. The MCP authenticates with a **different, separately-configured key** (see caveat below), so use REST or SDK with the run key.

Resolve the key and check in **one shell block** (each Bash call is a fresh shell — splitting `$KEY` resolution from the `curl` loses it). One `curl` returns body **and** status, so a miss shows its reason too:
```bash
# Run key: exported env wins; else source ./.env in a subshell (handles quotes, CRLF, comments, `export `)
KEY="${ORQ_API_KEY:-$(set -a; . ./.env 2>/dev/null; printf %s "$ORQ_API_KEY")}"
if [ -z "$KEY" ]; then
  echo "No ORQ_API_KEY in env or ./.env — STOP and ask the user for the key or its path"
else
  # Export so the run sees the SAME key this check used. `eq` reads ORQ_API_KEY from
  # the environment and does NOT auto-read ./.env when run directly — without this a
  # .env-only key passes the check below, then the run gets an empty key and fails
  # deep with a cryptic 401/404.
  export ORQ_API_KEY="$KEY"
  curl -s -w '\nHTTP %{http_code}\n' "https://api.orq.ai/v2/agents/<key>" -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY"
fi
# 200 → exists for the run key (confirm "status":"live" in the body — a draft/pending version isn't the published target)
# 404 → not found OR not in this key's project   ·   401 → bad key
```
Pipe the body through `jq` to read `project_id` / `status` / `memory_stores` / `knowledge_bases`.

**Deployment target** (`--target deployment:<key>`) — deployments have no single-retrieve endpoint; resolve the key with `get_config` instead (same run key, same project scoping):
```bash
curl -s -w '\nHTTP %{http_code}\n' -X POST "https://api.orq.ai/v2/deployments/get_config" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"key":"<key>"}'
# 200 → exists for the run key · 404 → deployment_not_found OR not in this key's project · 401 → bad key
```

**On a miss** (`404`): the key is wrong or scoped to another project. If the MCP shows the target but REST 404s, the run key is in the wrong project — **ask the user for the right key** (or its `.env`/path). Then re-check.

**If no key resolves** (not exported, no `.env`, or `.env` lacks it): **stop and ask the user** where the key lives or to paste it — "Which `.env`/path holds `ORQ_API_KEY`, or paste the key to use?" Don't guess a path, fabricate a key, or fall back to the MCP's key.

**Python SDK** — same call; reads `ORQ_API_KEY` from the env, so export the key you verified with:
```python
import os
from orq_ai_sdk import Orq
with Orq(api_key=os.environ["ORQ_API_KEY"]) as orq:   # KeyError if unset — don't pass "" silently
    print(orq.agents.retrieve(agent_key="<key>").status)  # raises if not found; want "live"
    # deployment target: orq.deployments.get_config(key="<key>")  # raises if not found
```

#### MCP caveat — a miss is not proof of nonexistence

The orq MCP (`mcp__orq-mcp-global__agent_get` / `agent_list`) is convenient for *browsing* and **can be correct**, but it uses its own key, often in a **different project** than the run. So neither verdict is authoritative for the run:

- **MCP miss ≠ agent absent** — its key may be in the wrong project; the agent may exist for your run key. Confirm with the REST/SDK check above, never conclude "no such agent" from an MCP miss.
- **MCP hit ≠ run will work** — it may see the agent in a project your run key can't reach; the run still dies with *Agent not found*.

The run key decides. If REST and MCP disagree, see the `Agent not found` row in [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting-common-failures) for how to resolve it. *Verified live: `agent_get` found `clarabelle-cow` while `curl` with a different-project key returned `404` for the same agent.*

## Plan the run — decide parameters with the user

Before the first `eq redteam run`, walk the user through these decisions. **Ask one step at a time** (use `AskUserQuestion` if you have that tool; otherwise ask in plain text) — each choice has a real coverage-vs-cost tradeoff. Default toward a small, scoped run first, then widen once the wiring is proven.

**Step 1 — Mode (where attacks come from).**

| Mode | Upside | Downside | Use when |
|------|--------|----------|----------|
| `dynamic` (default) | LLM generates fresh, adaptive attacks **tailored to your agent** (its system prompt, tools, and responses) → best signal, finds novel failures | Slowest + most expensive (attacker LLM + target + evaluator call per datapoint); non-deterministic | Exploring an agent's real robustness |
| `static` | Replays a fixed dataset → cheap, fast, reproducible, CI-friendly | Only as good as the dataset; finds nothing not already in it | Regression checks, baselines, gating |
| `hybrid` | Both legs in one report → widest coverage | Highest cost (pays for both) | One-shot baseline + exploration |

**Step 2 — Datapoint budget (the main cost lever).**

- Dynamic cap: `--max-dynamic-datapoints N`. Static cap: `--max-static-datapoints N`.
- **More datapoints →** higher coverage and a more *stable* ASR. One lucky resist out of 5 attempts is noise; out of 100 it's signal. But cost and wall-clock scale ~linearly, and the count is **per category** — 3 categories × 50 = 150 datapoints.
- **Fewer datapoints →** fast smoke test, but ASR is noisy and coverage is thin. Do **not** read a clean small run as "the agent is safe."
- Rough guide: **10–20** for a smoke test / wiring check, **50–100+** per scope for a real assessment.
- **Unset = the tool's built-in default**, not unlimited. Don't assume omitting the flag runs everything — but don't assume it's tiny either; check `eq redteam run --help` for the default if cost matters.
- **Static datapoints don't have to be hand-built.** The default `--dataset` is orq's large hosted set, `orq/redteam-vulnerabilities` on HuggingFace — point a `static`/`hybrid` run at it to test against a broad corpus out of the box. Only supply a local `--dataset` for custom scenarios.

**Step 3 — Vulnerability scope (what to test).**

- Two frameworks: **OWASP-ASI** (agentic failures — goal hijacking, tool misuse, memory poisoning; for orq agents with tools/memory) and **OWASP-LLM** (model-level — prompt injection, info disclosure, output handling). Full list in the [category table](#owasp-category-reference) below.
- `--category ASI01` (repeatable) tests a whole category. `--vulnerability goal_hijacking` (repeatable) targets one specific vuln and **takes precedence over `--category`**.
- **Wrong pick is low-stakes:** categories that don't apply to the agent (e.g. memory-poisoning on a memory-less agent, tool-misuse on an agent with no tools) are **automatically filtered out by the framework** — they won't waste datapoints or inflate the run. So lean toward selecting; over-picking is cheap, the framework prunes what can't apply.
- **Omit both = test everything** → broadest, but slowest and costliest. For a first run, pick **1–3 categories that match the agent's risk surface**:

| Agent has… | Test |
|------------|------|
| Tools / actions it can take | `ASI02` (tool misuse), `LLM06` (excessive agency) |
| A memory store | `ASI06` (memory & context poisoning) — note the memory-write caveat in Constraints |
| Untrusted user input | `ASI01` (goal hijacking), `LLM01` (prompt injection) |
| Secrets / a system prompt worth protecting | `LLM02` (info disclosure), `LLM07` (system prompt leakage) |

**Step 4 — One-off CLI or a reusable script?** Ask the user how they want it delivered:

- **One-off CLI** — fastest for a single exploratory run. Nothing to maintain.
- **Reusable script** (recommended for anything you'll repeat) — write the run into a small shell script (CLI) or a Python script (SDK). Upsides: easy to re-run after a fix (the fix → re-run loop in Constraints), reproducible, reviewable in version control, and the place to bake in the `.env`/`uv` credential handling so the trap can't resurface. Recommend this whenever the user is red-teaming a real agent they'll iterate on, or wiring it into CI. For the **Python SDK** route — the `red_team()` signature, target types (incl. external frameworks and `CallableTarget`), and programmatic report handling — load **[resources/python-sdk.md](resources/python-sdk.md)** rather than reconstructing the API from memory.

**Step 5 — Confirm and assemble.** Echo the chosen **mode + datapoint caps + categories + delivery (CLI vs script)** back to the user, **state the coverage gap** (which categories are *not* tested — a passing run only speaks to what was tested), then build the `eq redteam run` command (or script) from those choices.

## Core command: `eq redteam run`

All three modes use the same `run` command with a `--mode` flag.

```bash
eq redteam run \
  --target agent:<deployment-key> \
  --mode dynamic \
  [--category ASI01] \
  [--category ASI02] \
  [--max-dynamic-datapoints 50] \
  [--attack-model openai/gpt-5-mini] \
  [--evaluator-model openai/gpt-5-mini] \
  [--save-report ./output/my-run/report.json] \
  [--yes]
```

### Mode flag

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `dynamic` (default) | Live adaptive attack — generates adversarial prompts and sends them to the target agent |
| `static` | Evaluate a pre-built dataset (local file or HuggingFace) |
| `hybrid` | Both dynamic and static legs against the same target(s) |

### Key flags

These are the flags you need for a first run. For the complete set (`--max-static-datapoints`, `--max-per-category`, `--generated-strategy-count`, `--no-generate-strategies`, `--parallelism`, `--export-md`/`--export-html`, `--attacker-instructions`, `--name`, `--max-turns`, `--verbose`/`--quiet`, …) run `eq redteam run --help`.

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--target` / `-t` | required | `agent:<key>` or `deployment:<key>`. Repeatable for multi-target runs. (Raw models are SDK-only — see [Python SDK](#python-sdk-when-the-cli-cant)) |
| `--mode` | `dynamic` | Execution mode: `dynamic`, `static`, or `hybrid` |
| `--category` / `-c` | all | OWASP category to test (e.g. `ASI01`). **Repeatable** — pass once per category |
| `--vulnerability` / `-V` | all | Vulnerability ID (e.g. `goal_hijacking`) or OWASP code. Repeatable. Takes precedence over `--category` |
| `--max-dynamic-datapoints` | none | Cap dynamic (generated) attack datapoints — the main cost lever for a `dynamic` run |
| `--attack-model` | `gpt-5-mini` | Model generating adversarial prompts (prefix per route: `openai/gpt-5-mini` via gateway) |
| `--evaluator-model` | `gpt-5-mini` | Model judging whether attacks succeeded |
| `--system-prompt` | none | System prompt for the target model/agent |
| `--save` | `final` | `none` (no files, run not listed by `eq redteam runs`), `final` (summary JSON), or `detail` (all stage artifacts) |
| `--save-report` | none | Explicit path to write the report JSON |
| `--output-dir` | none | Directory for saved JSON stage files (**required** with `--save detail`) |
| `--dataset` | HuggingFace `orq/redteam-vulnerabilities` | Static/hybrid mode: local path, `hf:org/repo`, or `hf:org/repo/file.json` |
| `--no-cleanup-memory` | false | Keep memory entities written during a dynamic run instead of cleaning them up (debugging). Only relevant for memory-backed agents — see Constraints |
| `--yes` / `-y` | false | Skip confirmation prompt |

### Category examples

```bash
# Single category — Agent Goal Hijacking (OWASP ASI01)
eq redteam run --target agent:my-agent --category ASI01

# Prompt injection is LLM01 (not ASI01)
eq redteam run --target agent:my-agent --category LLM01

# Multiple categories — pass --category once per value
eq redteam run --target agent:my-agent --category ASI01 --category ASI02

# By vulnerability ID
eq redteam run --target agent:my-agent --vulnerability goal_hijacking

# Validate a custom dataset BEFORE running static mode against it
eq redteam validate-dataset ./my-dataset.json

# Static mode with local dataset
eq redteam run --target agent:my-agent --mode static --dataset ./my-dataset.json

# Hybrid mode — both dynamic and static legs
eq redteam run --target agent:my-agent --mode hybrid --category ASI01 --max-dynamic-datapoints 30 --max-static-datapoints 50

# Target a deployment instead of an agent
eq redteam run --target deployment:my-deployment --category ASI01
```

## Output and reports

After a run, the report is auto-saved to `.evaluatorq/runs/<name>_<ts>.json`. If `--save-report <path>` is passed, the report JSON is also written there.

With `--save detail` and `--output-dir <dir>`, staged artifacts are saved:

```
<output-dir>/
├── 01_all_datapoints.json      # All attack datapoints (static + dynamic)
├── 02_attack_results.json      # Raw per-datapoint attack results
└── 03_summary_report.json      # Aggregated summary
```

### Viewing reports

The run prints a summary to stdout on completion. To view an existing report interactively:

```bash
# List previous runs
eq redteam runs

# Launch interactive Streamlit dashboard for latest run
eq redteam ui

# Launch dashboard for a specific report
eq redteam ui ./path/to/report.json
```

### Reading the report JSON

Top-level fields in the report JSON:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `pipeline` | `dynamic`, `static`, or `hybrid` |
| `framework` | OWASP framework used (e.g. `OWASP-ASI`, `OWASP-LLM`) |
| `categories_tested` | List of OWASP categories covered in this run |
| `total_results` | Total attack datapoints in the report |

The `summary` sub-object contains aggregate stats:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `resistance_rate` | Fraction of attacks the agent resisted (0.0–1.0). Higher = more robust. |
| `vulnerabilities_found` | Count of attacks the agent failed (lower is better) |
| `vulnerability_rate` | Attack Success Rate (ASR). `1.0 - resistance_rate` |
| `total_attacks` | Total attack datapoints evaluated |
| `by_technique` | Per-technique breakdown with `vulnerabilities_found` and `resistance_rate` |

**Interpreting resistance_rate:** `1.0 - resistance_rate` = ASR. A `resistance_rate` of `0.65` means 35% of attacks succeeded.

## Acting on results — next steps

The summary tells you *how bad*; the `results` array tells you *what to fix*. Each item in `results[]` is one attack with everything needed to act:

| Field | Use it to |
|-------|-----------|
| `vulnerable` | `true` = the attack succeeded. **Filter to these first.** |
| `attack.category` / `attack.attack_technique` | Which OWASP category and technique broke through (e.g. `ASI01` / `tool_output_hijack`) |
| `attack.strategy_name` / `attack.objective` | The concrete adversarial goal that worked |
| `messages` | The full conversation sent to the agent — the exact prompts that landed |
| `response` | What the agent actually did/said when it failed |
| `evaluation.explanation` | The judge's reasoning for marking it vulnerable — the *why* |

**Workflow for a coding assistant after a run:**

```bash
REPORT=./output/my-run/report.json   # or the latest .evaluatorq/runs/<name>_<ts>.json

# 1. Headline: how many got through, and where it hurts most
jq '{asr: .summary.vulnerability_rate, found: .summary.vulnerabilities_found,
     by_technique: (.summary.by_technique | to_entries
       | map({(.key): .value.vulnerabilities_found}) | add)}' "$REPORT"

# 2. List every successful attack with the judge's reasoning
jq -r '.results[] | select(.vulnerable)
       | "## \(.attack.category)/\(.attack.attack_technique)  (\(.attack.strategy_name // "n/a"))\n"
       + "objective: \(.attack.objective // "n/a")\n"
       + "why: \(.evaluation.explanation)\n"' "$REPORT"

# 3. For one failure, read the exact transcript that broke the agent
jq '.results | map(select(.vulnerable)) | .[0] | {messages, response}' "$REPORT"
```

**Prioritize, then act.** Rank by `summary.by_technique` / `by_category` (highest `vulnerabilities_found` first), not by raw count of individual results. Then map each confirmed failure to a fix in the agent under test:

| Pattern in failures | Typical next step |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Goal hijacking (`ASI01`), prompt injection (`LLM01`) | Harden the system prompt; add an input-screening guard; separate trusted instructions from untrusted input |
| Tool misuse (`ASI02`), excessive agency (`LLM06`) | Restrict tool scope/permissions; add per-tool authorization checks; gate destructive actions |
| System prompt leakage (`LLM07`), info disclosure (`LLM02`) | Add output filtering; never place secrets in the prompt; redact before returning |
| Memory/context poisoning (`ASI06`) | Validate/scope memory writes; isolate per-session context |

After applying a fix, **re-run the same `--category`/`--vulnerability` scope** and confirm `vulnerability_rate` dropped — this is the feedback loop.

> **LLM-written recommendations** (`report.focus_area_recommendations`: ranked `category`, `risk_score`, `recommendations[]`, `patterns_observed`) are **SDK-only** — pass `generate_recommendations=True` to `red_team()`. The CLI does not produce them; mine `results[]` as above instead. See [resources/python-sdk.md](resources/python-sdk.md).

## OWASP category reference

Two frameworks. `framework` is `OWASP-ASI` or `OWASP-LLM` in the report. Note `ASI01` is goal hijacking, **not** prompt injection — prompt injection is `LLM01`.

| Code | Name (OWASP-ASI) | | Code | Name (OWASP-LLM) |
|------|------------------|-|------|------------------|
| `ASI01` | Agent Goal Hijacking | | `LLM01` | Prompt Injection |
| `ASI02` | Tool Misuse & Exploitation | | `LLM02` | Sensitive Information Disclosure |
| `ASI03` | Identity & Privilege Abuse | | `LLM03` | Supply Chain |
| `ASI04` | Supply Chain Vulnerabilities | | `LLM04` | Data and Model Poisoning |
| `ASI05` | Unexpected Code Execution | | `LLM05` | Improper Output Handling |
| `ASI06` | Memory & Context Poisoning | | `LLM06` | Excessive Agency |
| `ASI07` | Insecure Inter-Agent Communication | | `LLM07` | System Prompt Leakage |
| `ASI08` | Cascading Failures | | `LLM08` | Vector and Embedding Weaknesses |
| `ASI09` | Human-Agent Trust Exploitation | | `LLM09` | Misinformation |
| `ASI10` | Rogue Agents | | | _(LLM10 Unbounded Consumption is excluded — not prompt-testable)_ |

## Worked example

**Goal:** Red team the `customer-support-v2` deployment against goal hijacking (ASI01) and tool misuse (ASI02), routing the attack/evaluator LLM through the orq gateway.

```bash
# 1. Preflight — CLI present and ORQ_API_KEY set (hard-fail if missing)
eq --help >/dev/null 2>&1 || { echo "eq not found"; exit 1; }
[ -n "$ORQ_API_KEY" ] || { echo "ORQ_API_KEY not set — required for the agent target"; exit 1; }

# 2. Run dynamic red team (2 categories, 20 attack datapoints max, explicit model)
eq redteam run \
  --target agent:customer-support-v2 \
  --mode dynamic \
  --category ASI01 \
  --category ASI02 \
  --max-dynamic-datapoints 20 \
  --attack-model openai/gpt-5-mini \
  --evaluator-model openai/gpt-5-mini \
  --save-report ./output/customer-support-report.json \
  --yes

# 3. List runs and view summary
eq redteam runs

# 4. Open interactive dashboard (optional)
eq redteam ui ./output/customer-support-report.json
```

Expected summary fields in the printed output:

```
pipeline:           dynamic
categories_tested:  ASI01, ASI02
total_results:      20
resistance_rate:    0.65
vulnerabilities_found: 7
```

`resistance_rate: 0.65` → 35% attack success rate across 20 attempts.

## Troubleshooting common failures

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| `eq: command not found` | Package not installed or not on PATH | Run the discovery ladder (PATH / `.venv` / uv workspace / `python -m`) before installing; install into a project venv with `uv pip install 'evaluatorq[redteam]'` (global `uv tool install` only as a last resort) |
| `401 Incorrect API key` on `openai/...` despite `ORQ_API_KEY` set, when running via `uv run` | uv loaded `OPENAI_API_KEY` from an env-file (`UV_ENV_FILE` / explicit `--env-file`) after your `unset`, flipping routing to direct OpenAI (uv does **not** auto-read `./.env`) | `env -u OPENAI_API_KEY uv run --no-env-file …`, or run `eq` directly off PATH. See the uv `.env` trap section |
| `Agent not found` / `deployment_not_found` mid-run | Wrong `--target` key, **or** the shell `ORQ_API_KEY` is scoped to a different project than the target (MCP said it exists, but the run key can't see it) | Verify up front with the **shell `ORQ_API_KEY`** — agents via `GET /v2/agents/{key}` (or SDK `agents.retrieve`), deployments via `POST /v2/deployments/get_config` (or SDK `deployments.get_config`). An MCP hit alone is not proof — its key may be another project. On a mismatch, ask the user for the right key (the one scoped to the target's project). See "Verify the target agent or deployment exists" |
| `ORQ_API_KEY not set` or 401 errors | Missing env var for target agent | **Export** `ORQ_API_KEY` in your shell (`export ORQ_API_KEY=…`); a key only in `.env` is **not** auto-read by a bare `eq` run — see the preflight verify block, which exports it for you |
| `ImportError` for `openai`/`typer` | Incomplete install (missing extra) | `pip install 'evaluatorq[redteam]'` |
| `CredentialError` / run hangs at attack generation | No LLM credential for attack/evaluator | Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` (bare model names) **or** `ORQ_API_KEY` (provider-prefixed, e.g. `openai/gpt-5-mini`) |
| ASR = 0.0 on all categories | Evaluator routing/credential issue, or genuinely resistant | Confirm the evaluator model string matches the active route (gateway → `openai/gpt-5-mini`); check creds before assuming a stronger judge is needed |
| `openai/...` model rejected | `OPENAI_API_KEY` set → direct OpenAI rejects the prefix | Use a bare name (`gpt-5-mini`) for direct OpenAI, or unset `OPENAI_API_KEY` to route via the gateway |
| Confirmation prompt blocks CI | Interactive terminal required | Pass `--yes` / `-y` to skip |
| No runs shown in `eq redteam runs` | `--save none` was used | Re-run with `--save final` (default) or pass `--save-report <path>` |

## Python SDK (when the CLI can't)

The CLI covers the common case (red-teaming an orq `agent:`/`deployment:` target). For things it cannot do, use the `evaluatorq.redteam` Python API:

- **Red-teaming a raw model** — `OpenAIModelTarget`. The CLI deliberately **rejects** `openai:`/`llm:` target strings and points you here.
- **Red-teaming an agent built on an external framework** — LangGraph (`LangGraphTarget`), OpenAI Agents SDK (`OpenAIAgentTarget`), or **any callable** via `CallableTarget` (wrap an `async def(prompt) -> str` — far simpler than subclassing `AgentTarget`). Each needs its own install extra. See [Python SDK](resources/python-sdk.md#external-framework-targets).
- **Actionable remediation** — `red_team(..., generate_recommendations=True)` adds LLM-generated focus-area fixes to the report (`report.focus_area_recommendations`). SDK-only; not exposed on the CLI.
- Custom `AgentTarget` subclasses, or embedding red teaming in a Python eval pipeline.

**See [resources/python-sdk.md](resources/python-sdk.md)** for the `red_team()` signature, target types, a raw-model worked example, and programmatic report handling.

## Done when

- Run completes without errors
- Summary is printed to stdout (happens automatically after each run)
- Report JSON exists (in `.evaluatorq/runs/` or at `--save-report` path)
- Categories are described to the user by their correct names (e.g. ASI01 = Agent Goal Hijacking, not "prompt injection")
- Categories tested and coverage gaps are noted (e.g. "only ASI01–ASI02 tested; LLM01–LLM09 not covered")

## Companion skills

- `orq-build-evaluator` — build custom LLM judges for failure modes surfaced by red teaming
- `orq-analyze-trace-failures` — deeper failure taxonomy from production traces
- `orq-run-experiment` — run controlled experiments using orq deployments
